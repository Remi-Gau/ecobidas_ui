# Automatic text outputs from FSL

## For pre-processing with FEAT:

Analysis methods FMRI data processing was carried out using FEAT (FMRI Expert
Analysis Tool) Version 6.00, part of FSL (FMRIB's Software Library,
www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl). Registration to high resolution structural and/or
standard space images was carried out using FLIRT [Jenkinson 2001, 2002].
Registration from high resolution structural to standard space was then further
refined using FNIRT nonlinear registration [Andersson 2007a, 2007b].

## For first-level GLM:

Analysis methods FMRI data processing was carried out using FEAT (FMRI Expert
Analysis Tool) Version 6.00, part of FSL (FMRIB's Software Library,
www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl). Time-series statistical analysis was carried out using
FILM with local autocorrelation correction [Woolrich 2001].

## For second-level GLM:

Analysis methods FMRI data processing was carried out using FEAT (FMRI Expert
Analysis Tool) Version 6.00, part of FSL (FMRIB's Software Library,
www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl). Higher-level analysis was carried out using FLAME
(FMRIB's Local Analysis of Mixed Effects) stage 1 [Beckmann 2003, Woolrich 2004,
Woolrich 2008].

## Split up by me (Johannes Algermissen) for which references belongs to which action:

fMRI data for each of the six blocks per participants were preprocessed using
FSL 6.0.0 (Smith et al., 2004). Functional images were cleaned for non-brain
tissue (BET; Smith, 2002), segmented, motion-corrected (MC-FLIRT; Jenkinson,
Bannister, Brady, & Smith, 2002), and smoothed (FWHM 3 mm). Field maps were used
for B0 unwarping and distortion correction in orbitofrontal areas. We used
ICA-AROMA (Pruim et al., 2015) to automatically detect and reject independent
components in the data that were associated with head motion. Before running
GLMs, we performed high-pass filtering with a cutoff of 100 s and pre-whitening.
Co-registrations to high-resolution anatomical images (linearly with FLIRT using
Boundary-Based Registration) and to MNI152 2mm isotropic standard space
(non-linearly with FNIRT using 12 DOF and 10 mm warp resolution; Andersson,
Jenkinson, & Smith, 2007) were performed before fitting first-level GLMs.
